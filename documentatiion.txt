The surface created by this program has a cylindrical shape. It is defined by the formula:
R * cos(x), R * sin(x), y

The range for x is [0, 2Ï€], which forms a full circle in the x-y plane.
The range for y is [-10, 10], which extends along the z-axis from -10 to 10.
This creates a cylindrical surface that looks like a circle in the x-y plane with radius R and spans the z-axis from -10 to 10.

--------------------------

To make the surface easier to observe, the program uses the Pygame library to display and rotate the 3D surface. This lets you view the surface from different angles.

Make sure to install the following before running the program:

OpenGL version 1.2 or higher
Pygame library
See the "Installation" section for details.
