### Formula Explanation
1. **Representation**:
    - The formula describes points on the **surface of a cylinder** in 3D space.
    - It generates a **curved surface in the X-Y plane** (a circular base) for a range of heights along the Z-axis.

2. **Coordinate Breakdown**:
    - **`R * cos(x)`**: Represents the X-coordinate on a circle of radius `R`.
    - **`R * sin(x)`**: Represents the Y-coordinate on the same circle.
    - Together, `(R * cos(x), R * sin(x))` forms the points of a circle in the X-Y plane.

3. **Ranges**:
    - **Angle `x ∈ [0, 2π]`**:
        - Covers the entire circumference of the circle in the X-Y plane, occupying all four quadrants.
    - **Height `y ∈ [-10, 10]`**:
        - Defines the cylinder's vertical extent along the Z-axis, from `-10` to `10`.

### Key Insights
- **Base in X-Y Plane**:
    - The formula generates a circular path that **occupies the entire X-Y coordinate system** within a radius `R`.
    - The base is circular, extending in both positive and negative directions of the X and Y axes.

- **Curved 3D Surface**:
    - By varying `y` across its range, the formula creates a vertical extension of the circle, forming the **curved surface of the cylinder**.

## Visualization Details
- **X-Y Plane (Base)**:
    - A circle of radius `R`, generated by `(R * cos(x), R * sin(x))`.
    - Occupies all quadrants of the X-Y axis for `x ∈ [0, 2π]`.

- **Z-Axis (Height)**:
    - Extends vertically from `-10` to `10`, creating the height of the cylinder.

- **Final Output**:
    - A cylinder formed by combining the circular base with the height range.
