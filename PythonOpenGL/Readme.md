to generate the points for the surface, showcasing a 3D representation of a cylinder.

## Formula Explanation
1. **Representation**:
   - The formula describes points on the surface of a **cylinder** in 3D space.
   - It generates a **curved surface** in the X-Y plane (circular base) extended along the Z-axis.

2. **Coordinate Breakdown**:
   - **`R * cos(theta)`**: Represents the X-coordinate on a circle of radius `R`.
   - **`R * sin(theta)`**: Represents the Y-coordinate on the same circle.
   - Together, `(R * cos(theta), R * sin(theta))` forms points of a circle in the X-Y plane.
   - **`y`**: Represents the Z-coordinate, defining the height of the cylinder.

3. **Ranges**:
   - **Angle `theta ∈ [0, 2π]`**:
     - Covers the entire circumference of the circle in the X-Y plane, occupying all four quadrants.
   - **Height `y ∈ [-10, 10]`**:
     - Extends the cylinder vertically from `-10` to `10` along the Z-axis.

## Key Insights
- **Circular Base**:
  - The circular base of the cylinder occupies the X-Y coordinate system fully within a radius `R`, covering all four quadrants.

- **Vertical Extension**:
  - By varying `y` across its range, the formula extends the circle vertically, forming the cylindrical surface.

- **3D Visualization**:
  - The cylinder is displayed in a 3D space, along with axes for better orientation.

## Visualization Details
- **Coordinate Axes**:
  - Red: X-axis
  - Green: Y-axis
  - Blue: Z-axis

- **Surface**:
  - A semi-transparent cylindrical surface with a radius of `R = 5.0`.

- **Camera Perspective**:
  - The scene is set up with a camera view that allows rotation, providing a dynamic 3D perspective.
