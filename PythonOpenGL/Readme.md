# OpenGL Cylinder Visualization with Pygame

This project visualizes a 3D cylinder using OpenGL and Pygame, where the cylinder is drawn and animated with a vector field once a transparency threshold is reached. The cylinder rotates, and the axes are gradually revealed through transparency effects.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `pygame`
- `PyOpenGL`
- `numpy`

### Installation

You can install the required libraries via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy
